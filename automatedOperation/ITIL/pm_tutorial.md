## 概述

Problem Management aims to manage the lifecycle of all Problems. The primary objectives of this ITIL process are to prevent Incidents
from happening, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. 'Proactive Problem Management' analyzes 
Incident Records, and uses data collected by other IT Service Management processes to identify trends or significant Problems.
